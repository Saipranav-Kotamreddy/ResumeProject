# ResumeProject

This project is a website completely built from Scratch using HTML, JSP, MYSQL, and Java code by Saipranav Kotamreddy. 

The goal of this website is to house a large amount of resumes for a number of companies and allow companies to find resumes based on search criteria, like certain skills they are looking for. Users will log into the website under their company and be able to either upload resumes to the database or browse existing resumes.

Currently, the bulk of the website is split into 2 sections, the login portion and the resume upload/search portion.
